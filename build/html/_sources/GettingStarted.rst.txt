Helpful Resources
=================

The entire purpose of these docs is to make it easy to get started with code and electrical 
in FRC. Most of these docs resulted from consuming and regurgitating pre-existing FRC docs 
(ex. WPIlib docs) so that anyone can understand. Minor details may be missed or forgotten 
through the digestion process. Thus, here are some helpful resources that can help you when my 
docs inevitably forget to explain something.

* `WPIlib <https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html>`_: Everything programming 
  & electrical related is explained in detail here.
* `WPIlib API <https://first.wpi.edu/wpilib/allwpilib/docs/release/java/index.html>`_: Documents
  everything in WPIlib
* `CTRE Phoenix Docs <https://docs.ctre-phoenix.com/en/stable/>`_: Explains Phoenix API related topics
* `CTRE Phoenix API <https://store.ctr-electronics.com/content/api/java/html/index.html>`_: Documents
  everything in the Phoenix API
* `CTRE Phoenix Example Code <https://github.com/CrossTheRoadElec/Phoenix-Examples-Languages>`_: 
  Example Phoneix code
* `REV Spark Max Docs <https://docs.revrobotics.com/sparkmax/>`_: Explains Spark Max related topics
* `REV API <https://codedocs.revrobotics.com/java/com/revrobotics/package-summary.html>`_: Documents

.. note::
    After installing WPIlib, you will need to install your libraries to the project. 
    `Here <https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vscode-overview/3rd-party-libraries.html>`_
    is a short guide on how you can install the vendor libraries.
