Installation
============

Download the code from `here <https://github.com/TASRobotics/RaidOne-FRC-Template>`_ and open it
in WPIlib's VSCode. If random prompts pop up, use common sense and answer them.

.. note::
    Make sure that the code is not being backed up with Google Drive or Onedrive because it 
    screws things up. 

Installing Vendor Libraries

Ctrl + Shift + P --> Manage Vendor Libraries --> Install new libraries (offline) --> click the 
checkboxes
